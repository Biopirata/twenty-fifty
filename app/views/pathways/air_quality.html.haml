    %h2 How to interpret these results:
    %ul
      %li  Air pollution health impact index â€“ this index measures the effect on human health from fine particulate matter and other air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides.  For example, these pollutants have been linked to premature death caused by heart and lung disease.  2010 is the baseline year (100).  A number lower than 100 indicates a reduction in average air pollution and associated health impacts, whilst a higher number indicates an increase.  This index reflects changes in the average concentration of air pollutants across the UK.  It does not provide information on the number or severity of pollution hotspots.
      %li  Low end of hatched range &mdash; worst case scenario for air pollution whereby there is no further deployment or innovation in pollution abatement technology between now and 2050 beyond planned measures.
      %li  High end of hatched range &mdash; best case scenario whereby innovation radically improves pollution abatement technology between now and 2050 and it is fully deployed.
